# 2020: Break Reminder App
2020 is a break reminder app that helps in preventing digital eye strain and keep our 20-20 vision. 

A lot of us often find ourselves spending hours just tinkering around with our phone. This application lets you set a reminder for you to spend atleast 20 seconds every 20 minutes away from your phone. You may look around, think about the things that make you happy, or even grab a glass of water. 

As prescriped by eye doctors, the 20-20-20 rule does not only prevent eye strains but it will also help maintain healthy eye sight.

# Message from the Developer
Hey! I hope that you can find this application useful. I've spend few weeks developing this app mainly to solve my own issue. Due to constant use of electronic devices, I found myself having to grab a pair of glasses which made me thinking that I have to take care of my eyes more. 

This was yet another fun project, I learned a lot of things about Android development while doing this project specially with Broadcast Receivers and Services. Please feel free to send me a message if you have any concern or inquiries. Thank you
